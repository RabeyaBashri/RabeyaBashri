👋 Hi, I’m Rabeya Bashri

I am a research-oriented AI practitioner with a background in computer science and software engineering, working at the intersection of cognitive artificial intelligence, ethics-by-design, and responsible AI system architectures.

My work explores how governance, accountability, trust, and human cognitive constraints can be embedded directly into AI systems as architectural primitives, rather than being applied as post-hoc controls.

🧠 Research & Technical Interests

Cognitive and human-centered AI architectures

Ethics-gated machine learning pipelines

Automation bias detection and mitigation

Trust calibration in human–AI systems

Explainability versus genuine human understanding

Moral responsibility and delegation in AI-assisted decisions

Neuro-rights, mental privacy, and cognitive autonomy

🔬 Current Research Work
Cogent AI

Ethics-Gated Cognitive Artificial Intelligence Architecture

Cogent AI is a modular research prototype that investigates how AI systems can be designed to:

Admit only ethically governed and traceable data

Actively detect and mitigate automation bias

Calibrate trust rather than maximize persuasion

Respect human cognitive load and decision capacity

Preserve moral responsibility and accountability

Safeguard mental privacy and emerging neuro-rights

The project is intended as an academic research framework, not a production system, and serves as a platform for studying responsible AI architectures across the full system lifecycle.

🎓 Academic Direction

Preparing for research-based MSc programs

Long-term interest in doctoral research in cognitive and responsible AI

Seeking interdisciplinary academic environments bridging AI, cognitive science, ethics, and governance

🤝 Collaboration 

I am open to:

Academic research collaboration

MSc thesis and preparatory research projects

Interdisciplinary work connecting technical AI with ethical and cognitive inquiry
